PREFACE. xi

ᾖ 7. It has already been remarked that the manu-
, script is imperfect. The first gathering, containing the
services from the Nativity of our Lord to the Epiphany‚¹
is lost, and an occasional hiatus is here and there per-
‘' ceptible throughout the volume.² Towards the end, the
contents are of a very miscellaneous nature, successive
scribes having taken advantage of its blank pages (or
ι made them blank by erasure³) to enter upon them, as
’ into a kind of commonplace-book, an unconnected as·
ι ,εθωὶιΙαςθ of hymns, exorcisms‚ tables of contractions
ἓ used in civil law, etc. It is a misnomer‚ therefore,
, ‘5 to apply the title of ⁶ the Anglo-Saxon Ritual ’ to the
whole volume, although it would not be easy to point
ἵ out the exact line where the Ritual ends and the
' extraneous matter has its commencement.
ᾗ 8. It is unnecessary to adduce proofs of the asser-
* , tion which we have made respecting the extreme incor-
’ rectness of the Latin text3 they will present themselves

 

, to the reader before he has advanced through many
ι pages, Although the greater part of these are so gross
¹ that it would have been no difficult task to have cor-
rected them, yet there are otherS, especially in those in-
stances in which the present manuscript differs from the
